Basically I added the functionalities described in part 2 of introduction to unity scripting, except for the passing data between scenes, so that the final project is a full game with a main screen and a complete gameplay experience, scoring system and a way to lose.

The implementations include:

- Adding visuals (rotating hearts when a sheep is saved)
- Adding sound effects (When shooting, when a sheep is saved and when a sheep is droped)
- Keeping Score (Counting the saved and droped sheeps and showing it with UI)
- UI (Adding a main screen to play or quit the game)
